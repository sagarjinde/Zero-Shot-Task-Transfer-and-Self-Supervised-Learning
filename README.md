# Zero-Shot Task Transfer and Self-Supervised Learning

## Objective
Computed model parameters of a supervised task without any explicit supervision

## Get Started
This work is a modified version of [Zero-Shot Task Transfer](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/papers/Pal_Zero-Shot_Task_Transfer_CVPR_2019_paper.pdf).

Input tasks are self-supervised tasks and output tasks are supervised task

Go through the [report](https://github.com/sagarjinde/Zero-Shot-Task-Transfer-and-Self-Supervised-Learning/blob/master/report.pdf) for detailed explanation of the model

### Implementation Details
- Input tasks considered are:
	- Jigsaw
	- Autoencoding
	- Denoising
- Output task is:
	- Surface Normal

**Note:** Model architecture for all tasks considered should be the same 

Correlation matrix considered is the same as [Zero-Shot Task Transfer](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/papers/Pal_Zero-Shot_Task_Transfer_CVPR_2019_paper.pdf).

#### Training the model

![train mode](https://github.com/sagarjinde/Zero-Shot-Task-Transfer-and-Self-Supervised-Learning/blob/master/figs/train_model.png)

Model is trained in two modes:
- Self Mode
- Transfer mode

To explain training of the model, consider the following example with target task as one of the known task T<sup>1</sup>. i.e., consider i = 1

#### Self Mode
Backprop only W<sub>i</sub> and W<sub>common</sub>

![self mode](https://github.com/sagarjinde/Zero-Shot-Task-Transfer-and-Self-Supervised-Learning/blob/master/figs/self_model.png)

#### Transfer Mode
Backprop only W<sub>\negi</sub> and W<sub>common</sub>

#### Testing the model

To explain testing of the model, consider the following example with target task as an unknown task T<sup>4</sup>. i.e., consider i = 4

## Results

| Loss using weights generated by TTNet | Loss using weights learnt by supervised learning |
| --- | --- |
| 0.125560 | 0.180921 |
| 0.123371 | 0.180921 | 
| 0.122083 | 0.180921 |

**Model generated by TTNet outperforms model learnt by supervised learning by 32%**

**Note:** TTNet means Task Transfer Network
